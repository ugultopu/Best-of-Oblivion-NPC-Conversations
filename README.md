Best of Oblivion NPC Conversations
==================================
[Oblivion] is the fourth installment of The Elder Scrolls action-fantasy series of RPG video games created by Bethesda Game Studios. The game is an open-world RPG game set in a fantasy universe, full of eccentric characters. The player obtains quests and completes them in this open-world, while interacting with NPCs and other game elements.

"Oblivion NPC Conversation" is a meme about real-world interactions between people that feels as if the dialogue involves the NPCs of Oblivion. The features that make a conversation a good "Oblivion NPC Conversation" include:

- Tone and accent.
- Relatively frequent context-switches in the conversation.
- Nonsensical follow-ups to the conversation.
- General meaninglessness of the conversation.
